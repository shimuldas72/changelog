## About Changelog package
This package is responsible for logging create, update and delete event in a table and gives the admin a view of what is happening in this system. 

## Installation

    $ composer require sdas/changelog
    
After installing the package publish the config file

    $ php artisan vendor:publish --tag=changelog-config

Published config file will be found in the config folder of your laravel project. Update the config variables according to your project structure.

Publish and migrate the migrations

    $ php artisan vendor:publish --tag=changelog-migrations
    $ php artisan migrate

Now, run the command below to refresh all the cache

    $ php artisan optimize
    
Great, installation process is done.

Now use <b>Sdas\Changelog\Http\Traits\Trackable</b> trait in any class that extends <b>Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model</b> like this

    <?php
    namespace App\Models;

    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
    use Sdas\Changelog\Http\Traits\Trackable;
    class Democlass extends Model
    {
        use Trackable;
    }
    
Now this package will start to log changes of the table which is represented by your model where you used the <b>Trackable</b> trait.

To view the logs generated by this package go to <b>your_project_url/changelog</b>

## Instructions
1. Query with <b>DB::table</b> won't work in this package
2. For update and delete event you have to fetch the model object first and then run update command. 

    This won't work
    
        User::where('id', 10)->update(['name'=>'Test name']);
        User::where('id', 10)->delete();

    Do like this
    
        User::find(10)->update(['name'=>'Test name']);
        User::find(10)->delete();
